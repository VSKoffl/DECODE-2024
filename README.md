# DECODE-2024
This is the Biostatistics data analysis project which I, Vidyashankar Iyer, alongside Mr. Sibin and Mr. Arshith, had worked on for the DECODE 2024 Case study contest. We were announced the runners up for the work we had done. In this project, we had to analyze 3 datasets to study and test the efficacy and safety of an imaginary drug "Insula". Insula is a drug that is intended to cure Diabetes. The results clearly stated that the drug is effective but had side effect in the form of Body pain. The R codes and datasets have been attached. The summary ppt is a summarization of the results compiled in a ppt file.
